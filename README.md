The dark web is a hidden part of the internet that isn’t accessible through regular browsers or search engines. It works differently from the “surface web” (what you access with Google, Bing, etc.) and the “deep web” (private databases, intranet systems, or password-protected websites). Here’s how it works:
1. Layers of the Web
	•	Surface Web → Public, indexed by search engines (Google, Wikipedia, news sites).
	•	Deep Web → Content not indexed (bank accounts, email inboxes, medical records, etc.).
	•	Dark Web → A small portion of the deep web, intentionally hidden and accessible only with special tools (like Tor).
<img width="1123" height="794" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fa3a128-4031-4723-8456-6f7b275f9565" />



3. How It’s Accessed
	•	Requires special software such as:
	•	Tor (The Onion Router) → Most common, routes traffic through multiple encrypted nodes to hide your identity and location.
	•	I2P, Freenet, ZeroNet → Alternatives to Tor with different routing/encryption models.
	•	Websites on the dark web usually have “.onion” addresses instead of “.com” or “.org”.


4. How It Works (Behind the Scenes)
	•	Encryption: Every connection is encrypted in multiple layers (like an onion), so each relay only knows the previous and next step, not the full path.
	•	Anonymity: This makes it very difficult to trace the user’s location or activity.
	•	Hidden Services: Servers can host sites anonymously, without revealing their IP addresses.


5. What’s on the Dark Web
	•	Legitimate Use Cases:
	•	Journalists and whistleblowers share information anonymously.
	•	Activists in restrictive countries bypass censorship.
	•	Privacy-focused communities (forums, research).
	•	Illegal Activities:
	•	Black markets (drugs, weapons, stolen data).
	•	Hacking services and malware.
	•	Counterfeit documents, financial fraud.
	•	Exploitation material (very illegal).


6. Risks
	•	Legal Risks: Many activities are illegal; accessing or buying can lead to prosecution.
	•	Security Risks: Malware, phishing, scams are rampant.
	•	Privacy Risks: Even with Tor, mistakes (logging in with personal info, not using VPN, enabling JavaScript) can expose your identity.

the term “seed” in the dark web can mean a couple of different things depending on the context, because it’s not a single standardized word. Here are the main uses:

1. Torrent / File Sharing Context
	•	On both the surface web and the dark web, “seed” is often related to torrenting (BitTorrent, P2P sharing).
	•	Seeding = When you finish downloading a file, your client continues to upload/share pieces of it with other peers.
	•	A “seed” = A peer that has the entire file and is sharing it with others.
	•	Dark web marketplaces sometimes use torrent-like sharing systems to distribute tools, leaked data, or large files.


2. Seed Phrases / Wallets (Cryptocurrency)
	•	Since Bitcoin and Monero are the main payment methods on the dark web, “seed” is also used in crypto wallets.
	•	A “seed phrase” (12–24 words) is the recovery phrase that gives you full access to your wallet.
	•	Dark web vendors and buyers must protect their wallet seed phrase because whoever has it controls the funds.


3. Botnets / Malware Context
	•	In cybercrime forums, “seed” can also mean initial infection or first bots in a botnet.
	•	Example: an attacker “seeds” malware into victim machines (like phishing emails or cracked software) to grow a botnet.
	•	Those “seeds” become the base from which the malware spreads.

1. Awazon Market

    Direct link 1: awazonhndi7e5yfaobpk7j2tsnp4kfd2xa63tdtzcg7plc5fka4il4ad.onion/auth/register_now
    Direct link 2: awazonmphskqrqr5fquam6h24dcifybo4wlzqzlw52edkn3nzfnmh6qd.onion/auth/register_now

Established in 2020, Awazon Market has quickly become one of the most famous darknet marketplaces. The market claims to provide secure and anonymous commerce services. You can find a lot of goods and services packed with stealth high-level encryption, no JavaScript, and anti-DDoS protection. This ensures a maximum level of privacy.

The marketplace requires registration. Understandably, as in the case with most illicit trade markets, you don’t even need to verify your email Awazon. It has a simple interface with several advanced features.

It has a search option to let you find local and international products and services on the dark web. A lot of vendors from all over the world are registered here, offering an extensive range of products, including digital services, security tools, and other equipment. For those who are looking for a reliable Alphabay Market alternative, Awazon Market aspires to become the solution.
2. Torzon market

    Direct link: https://torzon4kv5swfazrziqvel2imnxcckc4otcvopiv5lnxzpqu4v4m5iyd.top/index.php

Torzon Market showed up on the dark web in September 2022, and it’s been growing steadily ever since. These days, it lists over 11,600 illegal items, including hard drugs, hacking tools, and all kinds of cybercrime services. It also runs on the Tor network, which helps keep things anonymous.

One interesting aspect about Torzon is how it builds trust. It brings in vendor reviews from other places and verifies them using PGP signatures, so buyers can feel a bit more confident about who they’re dealing with. There’s also a premium account option for users who want extra benefits. And when it comes to paying, the site sticks to Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR) to keep transactions private.
3. WeTheNorth

    Direct link: http://hn2paw7qy4prhgvqikn6dqujbsxdar7cwsgk3kmew2bxu4haj4jyykid.onion

While this market started in Canada in 2021, WeTheNorth now sells to both Canadian and international users. It’s a market for fake documents, hacking software, and financial fraud services. WeTheNorth has a strong community vibe, with an active forum where users interact and share updates. But it’s not open to just anyone.

Plus, there’s a thorough vetting process for new buyers and sellers to keep the community more secure. In a way, it feels more like a private club than an open market, and that’s exactly how the operators want it.
4. Russian Market

    Direct link: http://rumarkstror5mvgzzodqizofkji3fna7lndfylmzeisj5tamqnwnr4ad.onion/login

Don’t let the name fool you. The Russian Market isn’t exclusive to Russian-speaking clients. In fact, everything is in English, and the site picks up users everywhere in the world. What sells there? People visit this market to buy stolen credit cards, personal data, remote desktop account credentials, and logs gathered from information-stealing malware.

You can even find things such as BIN checkers and PayPal cookie converters. Another reason the Russian Market is so popular is that it’s pretty inexpensive compared to other dark web marketplaces.
5. Brian’s Club

    Direct link: https://brians.cc/register

Just as there are new entrants, the dark web has its veteran markets too, and Brian’s Club is one such market. It has been in operation for more than a decade since its debut in 2014. Brian’s Club is one of the best place to buy stolen credit card info, including CVVs, dumps, and even full account packages without revealing your identity.

The marketplace supports multiple payment methods, including Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Cryptocheck. They add new batches of stolen data every other week, and there’s even a bidding system where buyers can place offers on new data batches as soon as they become available.
6. STYX Market

    Direct link: N/A

Wondering if there’s an OG darknet market for financial crimes? Cybersecurity experts believe STYX is the one. The market facilitates trades in stolen credit card data, hacked bank accounts, and services to facilitate the laundering of cryptocurrency.

One of the things STYX is infamous for is having a rigorous verification process for users that makes it seem more exclusive. They even have a Telegram channel to provide their clients with live updates. How do people pay to employ their services? Like most of the markets, STYX supports Bitcoin (BTC), Monero (XMR), and other crypto tokens to keep everyone’s identity hidden on this marketplace.

It’s shocking to see they have multiple clear web addresses but no onion URL (tells you a lot about how complicated these illicit markets can be; they could be plotting users on the surface web who don’t have any security shield, like Tor in the case of onion sites, as they can’t be accessed without it). These markets are dangerous anyway and shouldn’t be accessed even if they’ve onion addresses.
7. Abacus Market

    Direct link: https://abacuseeettcn3n2zxo7tqy5vsxhqpna2jtjqs7cgdjzl2jascr4liad.top/

Next up is Abacus, another newer market that has already made a massive name for itself, especially following AlphaBay’s closure. It contains 40,000+ listings for illegal products (mostly) and is worth an estimated $15 million, so it’s one of the largest markets out there.

People go on to buy literally anything. Want to get illegal drugs, fake passports, Trojan, or other cyber attack software? Abacus Market is your sure plug.
8. Vice City

    Direct link: http://vicecitkf7sv4aosm6xfa4yjpwellcuqyyxwearrz44ufdecdqwhulad.onion/

Vicy City is a new but popular marketplace on the dark web. The site allows users to find and buy a vast variety of products and services. It’s known for its strong security features (like a trusted escrow system, PGP two-factor authentication) and anonymity.

Whether you want some pharmaceutical products (drugs) or digital items, you will probably find the products here, and that too at affordable prices. One of the site’s standout features is its customer support. Vice City listens to the problems faced by its customers and vendors and solves them so that they can keep using the platform with ease. To access the marketplace, dark web users must register first and pass the CAPTCHA test to prove they are human.

Vice City market places strong emphasis on privacy and anonymity. It supports cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR) for a secure trading environment.
9. Exodus Marketplace

    Direct link: https://exodusmarket.io/login

This marketplace was launched in January 2024, and it’s been growing since then. It mainly sells stealer logs (malware software that is used to collect or steal users’ data).

These logs can collect sensitive information like credit card details, login credentials, local files, and cookie data. For this reason, the marketplace identifies itself as the key player in criminal activities like fraud.

Exodus Marketplace started to become popular after the shutdown of Genesis Market, and it replaced it successfully. It claims to control more than 7,000 bots from 190+ countries, with data prices ranging from $3 to $10, based on the quality it offers. The marketplace has a simple interface, lets users filter logs easily, and accepts Bitcoin, Monero, and Litecoin for payments.

One notable fact is that the site has changed its domain twice since its formation. This is to address security concerns and to improve its presence. Today, Exodus Marketplace works from 3 different domains, two of which are its mirrors.
10. BidenCash

    Direct link: N/A

BidenCash is another latest marketplace that started in 2022, and is now home to sensitive financial data transactions. This is where cybercriminals go to buy and sell things like stolen credit card numbers, personally identifiable information (PII), and even SSH login details. One thing that distinguishes BidenCash on the dark web, however, is how it markets itself.

The site gives out free samples of the stolen data every now and then to gain more customers. It also uses a strict authentication process to deter scammers. With its fast rise to fame and focus on money fraud, it’s no surprise that cybersecurity experts are keeping a very close eye on this one.

BidenCash was launched in 2022, and since it became a hot spot for cybercriminals to sell and buy illegal things, including stolen card information and personal data. However, in June 2025, BidenCash’s relevant domains (around 145) were seized by the US Department of Justice.

What do people sell or exchange on darknet markets?
As we mentioned earlier, not everything sold on dark web markets is illegal. As terrible as its reputation may be, some vendors sell legitimate goods or services. Some customers even use the dark web to make anonymous purchases, especially in areas where privacy is a huge concern. So, not everyone who shops there is looking for something illegal.

However, if we’re being honest, the majority of activity on darknet markets involves illegal or heavily regulated items. Most sellers sell illegal goods and services. A 2020 study found that almost 57% of sites on the Tor network hosted some form of illegal content.

Let’s review what exactly is being sold on these darknet marketplaces and identify their target buyers.
Guns and weapons

Surprisingly, most guns on the darknet actually start as legal products. That’s right. The UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime) maintains that almost all firearms are originally manufactured through legal means.

But somewhere between production and purchasing, things can get dirty. For example, an insider or factory employee might quietly slip away with an unmarked gun and sell it online. Once it lands on a darknet marketplace, it becomes part of the illegal weapons trade.

Why do people buy weapons this way? In many countries, strict laws limit who can legally buy, own, or carry firearms. So when someone like a private buyer or criminal group can’t pass the background checks or get the right permits, they usually turn to the dark web to sidestep the rules and get armed without drawing attention.
Criminal hacking services

The dark web isn’t just a place for shady shopping. It’s also a marketplace for digital mercenaries; you’ll find everything from solo hackers offering their skills to well-organized groups that take on more complex or high-stakes projects. Some even have connections to criminal organizations and, in more serious cases, government-backed operations.

These hackers don’t hide in the shadows as much as you might think. In fact, many openly advertise their services on darknet forums. What can you hire them for? Anything from planting malware and stealing sensitive files to hijacking email accounts or breaking into social media profiles. Some services even target entire companies or public systems.

While hiring a hacker might sound like something out of a movie, it’s a very real threat. Businesses may use these services to sabotage their competitors, while individuals may seek revenge or simply want access to private information about someone.
Stolen personal information

These markets are a hot spot for selling stolen personal data. This can include everything from full names, email logins, and passwords to credit card details, social security numbers, and bank account information. The cybercriminals trade even sensitive documents, such as medical records, passport information, and driver’s licenses.

The fallout for victims whose data is stolen and sold can be devastating. They suffer losses such as identity theft, financial loss, and emotional distress due to damage to their personal and professional lives. Yet, for vendors on the dark web, it’s all about profit. They really don’t care about the loss and dilemma of the victims whose data has been stolen.
Explicit and illegal content

Unfortunately, the dark web hosts not only explicit but also deeply illegal and disturbing content. The markets often share materials related to child exploitation, pornography, and non-consensual recordings, all of which are serious crimes that inflict lasting harm on real-life victims. Such content fuels a dangerous cycle of abuse, violence, and exploitation.

As sad and gruesome as it is, the anonymity the dark web provides makes it much harder for law enforcement to track down and prosecute the perpetrators, take down the content, and help the victims. International agencies continue to work tirelessly to shut down such sites and prosecute offenders.

Still, the existence of this content is a grim reminder of the dark web’s potential for abuse when left unchecked.
Illegal or hard drugs

This is probably the most common category. The Guardian once reported darknet markets as the “eBay of drug dealing,” and that’s not far off. You can find every type of drug that is illegal. Whether it’s marijuana, LSD, prescription pills, or harder substances, you’ll always find them listed on these platforms just like products on Amazon.

Drug dealers can sell to customers across the world, not just locally. This expanded reach, combined with anonymity, only makes it easier for them to grow their operations without getting caught immediately.

1. Exit scams

Imagine trusting a site where you’ve been buying or selling for months, and everything seems legit. But one day, without warning, the site vanishes. That’s an exit scam. Some marketplace operators first build trust by running a legitimate platform.

Once many users begin to rely on the site and store funds in escrow, the operators disappear, taking all the money with them and leaving their customers and clients with nothing.
2. Money laundering

Sometimes, people visit the dark web to move dirty money. Some vendors offer services to help people “clean” illegally obtained funds using cryptocurrency and fake transactions. They mix and transfer funds through various privacy wallets and escrow services to hide the original source and make the illicit transactions harder to trace.

While this may all sound sophisticated, it is a financial crime and very risky. Those who use these services can still be traced and prosecuted if caught, especially as law enforcement continues to sharpen its tracking tools.
3. Ponzi schemes

Too-good-to-be-true investment offers are another classic scam on the dark web. Ponzi schemes promise high returns with little to no risk. Early participants may see some profit, but that money usually comes from new victims, not actual earnings. Eventually, the system collapses, and most people lose their entire investment. So, if a “business opportunity” sounds too perfect, it probably is.
4. Malware sales

Many people go to the dark web to buy things they can’t find elsewhere, but what if what you’re buying is also trying to harm you? That’s the reality with malware sales. Scammers on darknet markets claim to offer legit tools or services, but instead provide you with malicious software that can infect your device.

Once you unknowingly install the spyware or ransomware, they can steal your identity or even hijack your crypto wallet.
5. Phishing attacks

Just like on the regular internet, phishing is a big problem on the dark web as well. How do they plan these attacks? Fraudsters create fake versions of popular darknet sites to trick users into entering login details or personal data. If you fall for it and log in, they immediately steal your credentials and either sell or use them for other scams.

On the dark web, even a minor slip-up can cause you big consequences. So, you need to be extremely cautious because the fake sites are often very similar to the real ones, making them dangerously convincing.

The anonymity and lack of rules that define darknet marketplaces are exactly what make them breeding grounds for fraudulent activities. Of course, the promise of secrecy and unfiltered access might lure you in, but those same features are what make the environment so risky.

If for any reason, you decide to visit these hidden corners of the web, ensure you at least study and understand the common traps. Getting familiar with the tactics scammers use will go a long way in helping you protect your online data and assets.

Remember, staying informed is your best defense against misinformation. When you know what to expect, you’re less likely to fall for a trick and should be able to keep your identity safe.
Did the Silk Road marketplace go under?
Did Silk Road marketplace go under?

You probably wouldn’t know of Silk Road if you’re new to darknet marketplaces. It was the first big one and the original trailblazer. You could call it the Amazon of the dark web, but it worked only on the Tor browser. Anyone could buy and sell products or services anonymously using Bitcoin.

While you could find all sorts of products on Silk Road, drug sales quickly became prevalent because of the profits it raked in. In fact, by 2013, a Guardian article revealed that about 70% of listings were drug-related. But, like all things in the underworld, it didn’t last.

Later, in 2013, Silk Road caught the attention of law enforcement and policymakers like US Senator Charles Schumer, who publicly called for a federal crackdown. That push led to the arrest of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, after a long and intense investigation.

Ulbricht faced several serious charges, including distributing illegal drugs, running a criminal enterprise, hacking, trafficking fake IDs, and money laundering. In the end, he was sentenced to life in prison for running one of the largest and most scandalous dark web cases in history.

Even though Silk Road is long gone, its impact is still here. It became the blueprint for other dark web marketplaces that tried to take its place. But just like Silk Road, many of them didn’t last forever.

Here are a few that followed in its footsteps and quickly met the same fate:

    Silk Road 2.0: This was supposed to be the comeback version of the original Silk Road and debuted just one month after the original’s shutdown. But the police took it down too in 2014, about a year later.
 <img width="1312" height="721" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c27562d9-0487-426d-85b2-dfd47380c3ca" />
 
	
Black Goblin Market: This market joined the dark web in 2014 but went down shortly after because of a serious security flaw.
Utopia: Utopia barely got a chance to exist. It went live in 2014 but stopped operations just eight days later after undercover agents infiltrated the site.
Why the Dark Web Matters for OSINT

The dark web refers to a part of the internet not indexed by search engines and accessible only through specialized software like Tor or I2P. These platforms often host criminal marketplaces, underground forums, and whistleblower platforms. For OSINT analysts, the dark web is invaluable for:



Detecting early signs of compromise

Monitoring hacker communities and threat groups

Identifying leaked credentials and sensitive data

Investigating fraud, trafficking, and other cybercrimes

Adding underground context to threat intelligence reports 

How to Safely Access the Dark Web

To explore the dark web without compromising your identity or system security, follow these essential safety protocols:

    Use the Tor Browser with strict security configurations

    Always connect via a VPN before using Tor

    Avoid using any personal or traceable information

    Use virtual machines (VMs) to isolate your activity

    Do not click on unverified or suspicious links
