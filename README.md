The dark web is a hidden part of the internet that isn’t accessible through regular browsers or search engines. It works differently from the “surface web” (what you access with Google, Bing, etc.) and the “deep web” (private databases, intranet systems, or password-protected websites). Here’s how it works:
1. Layers of the Web
	•	Surface Web → Public, indexed by search engines (Google, Wikipedia, news sites).
	•	Deep Web → Content not indexed (bank accounts, email inboxes, medical records, etc.).
	•	Dark Web → A small portion of the deep web, intentionally hidden and accessible only with special tools (like Tor).

2. How It’s Accessed
	•	Requires special software such as:
	•	Tor (The Onion Router) → Most common, routes traffic through multiple encrypted nodes to hide your identity and location.
	•	I2P, Freenet, ZeroNet → Alternatives to Tor with different routing/encryption models.
	•	Websites on the dark web usually have “.onion” addresses instead of “.com” or “.org”.

⸻

3. How It Works (Behind the Scenes)
	•	Encryption: Every connection is encrypted in multiple layers (like an onion), so each relay only knows the previous and next step, not the full path.
	•	Anonymity: This makes it very difficult to trace the user’s location or activity.
	•	Hidden Services: Servers can host sites anonymously, without revealing their IP addresses.

⸻

4. What’s on the Dark Web
	•	Legitimate Use Cases:
	•	Journalists and whistleblowers share information anonymously.
	•	Activists in restrictive countries bypass censorship.
	•	Privacy-focused communities (forums, research).
	•	Illegal Activities:
	•	Black markets (drugs, weapons, stolen data).
	•	Hacking services and malware.
	•	Counterfeit documents, financial fraud.
	•	Exploitation material (very illegal).

⸻

5. Risks
	•	Legal Risks: Many activities are illegal; accessing or buying can lead to prosecution.
	•	Security Risks: Malware, phishing, scams are rampant.
	•	Privacy Risks: Even with Tor, mistakes (logging in with personal info, not using VPN, enabling JavaScript) can expose your identity.

the term “seed” in the dark web can mean a couple of different things depending on the context, because it’s not a single standardized word. Here are the main uses:

⸻

1. Torrent / File Sharing Context
	•	On both the surface web and the dark web, “seed” is often related to torrenting (BitTorrent, P2P sharing).
	•	Seeding = When you finish downloading a file, your client continues to upload/share pieces of it with other peers.
	•	A “seed” = A peer that has the entire file and is sharing it with others.
	•	Dark web marketplaces sometimes use torrent-like sharing systems to distribute tools, leaked data, or large files.

⸻

2. Seed Phrases / Wallets (Cryptocurrency)
	•	Since Bitcoin and Monero are the main payment methods on the dark web, “seed” is also used in crypto wallets.
	•	A “seed phrase” (12–24 words) is the recovery phrase that gives you full access to your wallet.
	•	Dark web vendors and buyers must protect their wallet seed phrase because whoever has it controls the funds.

⸻

3. Botnets / Malware Context
	•	In cybercrime forums, “seed” can also mean initial infection or first bots in a botnet.
	•	Example: an attacker “seeds” malware into victim machines (like phishing emails or cracked software) to grow a botnet.
	•	Those “seeds” become the base from which the malware spreads.
