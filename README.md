The dark web is a hidden part of the internet that isn’t accessible through regular browsers or search engines. It works differently from the “surface web” (what you access with Google, Bing, etc.) and the “deep web” (private databases, intranet systems, or password-protected websites). Here’s how it works:
1. Layers of the Web
	•	Surface Web → Public, indexed by search engines (Google, Wikipedia, news sites).
	•	Deep Web → Content not indexed (bank accounts, email inboxes, medical records, etc.).
	•	Dark Web → A small portion of the deep web, intentionally hidden and accessible only with special tools (like Tor).

2. How It’s Accessed
	•	Requires special software such as:
	•	Tor (The Onion Router) → Most common, routes traffic through multiple encrypted nodes to hide your identity and location.
	•	I2P, Freenet, ZeroNet → Alternatives to Tor with different routing/encryption models.
	•	Websites on the dark web usually have “.onion” addresses instead of “.com” or “.org”.

3. How It Works (Behind the Scenes)
	•	Encryption: Every connection is encrypted in multiple layers (like an onion), so each relay only knows the previous and next step, not the full path.
	•	Anonymity: This makes it very difficult to trace the user’s location or activity.
	•	Hidden Services: Servers can host sites anonymously, without revealing their IP addresses.

4. What’s on the Dark Web
	•	Legitimate Use Cases:
	•	Journalists and whistleblowers share information anonymously.
	•	Activists in restrictive countries bypass censorship.
	•	Privacy-focused communities (forums, research).
	•	Illegal Activities:
	•	Black markets (drugs, weapons, stolen data).
	•	Hacking services and malware.
	•	Counterfeit documents, financial fraud.
	•	Exploitation material (very illegal).

5. Risks
	•	Legal Risks: Many activities are illegal; accessing or buying can lead to prosecution.
	•	Security Risks: Malware, phishing, scams are rampant.
	•	Privacy Risks: Even with Tor, mistakes (logging in with personal info, not using VPN, enabling JavaScript) can expose your identity.
